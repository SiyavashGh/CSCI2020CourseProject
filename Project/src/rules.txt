Checkers is a fun, challenging, and relatively easy to learn game.

Checkers is a board game played between two people on an 8x8 checked board like the one shown below.
Each player has 12 pieces that are like flat round disks that fit inside each of the boxes on the board.
The pieces are placed on every other dark square and then staggered by rows
Each Checkers player has different colored pieces. The pieces are black and red.

Taking a Turn

Typically the darker color pieces moves first. Each player takes their turn by moving a piece.
Pieces are always moved diagonally and can be moved in the following ways:
Diagonally in the forward direction (towards the opponent) to the next dark square.
If there is one of the opponent's pieces next to a piece and an empty space on the other side, you jump your opponent and remove their piece.
You can do multiple jumps if they are lined up in the forward direction. *** note: if you have a jump, you have no choice but to take it.

Winning the Game

You win the game when the opponent has no more pieces or can't move (even if he/she still has pieces).
If neither player can move then it is a draw or a tie.
