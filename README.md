# How to run
to run you may use the gradle build file, but we experienced inconsistencies, so to counter that
the files must downloaded then opened on intellij. From there build the project and run the servermain 
first followed by the LOGIN(note to run multiple clients tou must have allowed parallel run under configurations).
once the client is run you will be prompted to login proceed by creating a new user name, once that is completed on both clients you may begin the game.

the server ports are hard coded to work over localhost for your testing purposes. the port selection scene was omitted intentionally and as mentioned above we were unable to get out gradle file to work consistently. the final bug is with the highscore button as it does not lead to the correct destination consistently.
